# How to become a resolver

To fill an order, a resolver should be whitelisted and have enough balance to pay the order fee. So below are the overview of steps to do to start resolving:

1. Stake enough 1inch to have enough staking power to be in top-5 registered resolvers list;
2. Register as a resolver (in whitelist and delegation) and set worker address
3. Deposit 1inch to FeeBank to cover resolving fees
4. Resolve swaps
